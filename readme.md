**Transforming agriculture in Sikkim with intelligent, accessible, and water-saving technology.**

Smart Farm is a comprehensive dashboard and alert system designed specifically for the needs of farmers in Sikkim. Our platform provides real-time data on soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop health, empowering farmers to make smarter, data-driven decisions. By integrating with robust hardware and offering multi-language support, we aim to save water, protect crops from pests and disease, and ultimately increase yield and profitability.
